# Plan for Enhanced Reporting and Analytics System

This document outlines the plan to improve the analytics, design, graphing, and tracking capabilities of the application.

## Phase 1: Foundational Improvements - Data & Tracking

**Objective:** Enhance the data we collect and how we track user interactions to provide a solid foundation for analytics.

1.  **Define Key Metrics:**
    *   Identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for user engagement and quiz performance.
    *   Examples: Average score, completion rate, time per question, most frequently missed questions, user retention.
2.  **Granular Event Tracking:**
    *   Refine `js/api.js` and `js/main.js` to track more specific user events.
    *   Events to track: quiz start, question answer (with answer chosen), quiz completion, review session start, etc.
    *   Standardize the event data structure (e.g., using a JSON schema).
3.  **Data Model Review:**
    *   Analyze the current data storage (`data/batch-1.json`).
    *   Design a more scalable data model for storing analytics data. This might involve moving away from flat JSON files to a more structured format or a database if the application scales.

## Phase 2: Backend for Analytics

**Objective:** Process and serve the collected data efficiently.

1.  **Analytics API Endpoints:**
    *   Design and implement new API endpoints in `js/api.js` to serve aggregated analytics data.
    *   Example endpoints: `/api/analytics/summary`, `/api/analytics/quiz/:id`, `/api/analytics/user/:id`.
2.  **Data Aggregation:**
    *   Create scripts or backend logic to process raw tracking data into meaningful aggregations.
    *   This could be a batch process that runs periodically or real-time aggregation depending on requirements.

## Phase 3: Reporting Dashboard - Design & UI/UX

**Objective:** Create a user-friendly and insightful reporting interface.

1.  **Dashboard Wireframing & Design:**
    *   Sketch out the layout for the new analytics dashboard.
    *   Focus on clarity and ease of use. The design should tell a story with the data.
    *   Incorporate modern UI/UX principles.
2.  **Charting Library Selection:**
    *   Evaluate and choose a JavaScript charting library.
    *   Options: Chart.js, D3.js, ApexCharts, etc.
    *   Selection criteria: ease of use, performance, variety of chart types, and licensing.
3.  **UI Component Development:**
    *   Create reusable UI components for the dashboard in `js/ui.js`.
    *   Components: date range pickers, filter dropdowns, summary cards, chart containers.

## Phase 4: Frontend Implementation

**Objective:** Build the interactive and visual reporting dashboard.

1.  **Dashboard Development:**
    *   Create a new HTML file for the dashboard (e.g., `analytics.html`) or integrate into an existing page.
    *   Use the components from `js/ui.js` to build the layout.
2.  **API Integration:**
    *   Connect the dashboard to the new analytics API endpoints.
    *   Fetch and display the data on the dashboard.
3.  **Graph Implementation:**
    *   Use the selected charting library to create various visualizations:
        *   Line charts for trends over time.
        *   Bar charts for comparisons (e.g., question performance).
        *   Pie/Doughnut charts for score distributions.
        *   Heatmaps for user activity.
4.  **Interactivity:**
    *   Implement features like:
        *   Filtering data by date range, quiz, or user.
        *   Drill-down capabilities on charts.
        *   Exporting data to CSV/PDF.

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

**Objective:** Ensure the new system is reliable and bug-free.

1.  **End-to-End Testing:**
    *   Test the entire workflow from data tracking to visualization.
    *   Verify data accuracy and consistency.
    *   Perform UI testing across different browsers and devices.
2.  **Deployment:**
    *   Roll out the new analytics features.
    *   Monitor system performance and user feedback.
